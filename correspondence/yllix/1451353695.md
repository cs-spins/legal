Hello there! 

I have been enjoying your service so far, however we have run into one small problem. 
We use HTTPS/SSL on our website, and your ads will not load for users because your ads are being 
loaded over a non-secured connection (mixed-content). Is there any possible way you can open up SSL
on your site? CloudFlare.com is what we use for free SSL. Otherwise, we will have to use an image 
proxy or stop using the service entirely. 

Thank you, 
Justin O'Boyle from cs-spins.com
