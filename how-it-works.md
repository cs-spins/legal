# HOW IT WORKS!

The process of using CSBets is fairly simple...

First, you need to login to our site using steam. This is done by clicking the "Login with steam" button on the top right of the website.

NOTE: We never log any information of your steam account other than - username, trade link, profile link and profile picture. This is so you don't have to take time setting up a profile.

After that you need to copy then paste your Steam trade link into the "Steam trade link" box found in four profile settings page.

Once you have done that you will be able to start going in on the "pots" which can be found on the main page. This is done by clicking the "deposit" box on the main page.

Now that you have deposited your ideal skins (The more/price you put in the better chance you will have to win other users skins.) send the items as a gift to our bot account and within seconds you should be in on the "pot".

NOTE: You don't have to just put in skins, we accept other CS:GO items like cases, stattrak swappers, keys and nametags.

Finally you have to wait for the timer to run down and then the sipper will choose a random user. Remember the higher value of skins you put in will help your chance of winning.

If you win you will be sent a trade confirmation from one of our bots. 

NOTE: We do not "tax" any items so you will always receive everything you won! 

Thank you for reading and good luck!
